This is a reboot of the Openlabs_OpenERPConnector. This module will be refactored and any component that 
affects core functionality will be removed.

This module will not contain the imported attribute as its redundant and not needed. Additional calls will 
be added to support faster api response time such as multiload for products and sales orders.
Other calls will be added to peform multiple functions such as invoice and track orders, or ship with 
tracking number
